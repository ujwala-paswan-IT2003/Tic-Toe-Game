# Tic-Toe-Game
### Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python ðŸŽ®

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game in Python. The game allows two players to play on the same system, alternating turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 board until one player wins or the game results in a draw.

#### Key Features:
- **2-Player Mode**: Two players take turns playing as 'X' and 'O'.
- **Game Status**: Displays the current status of the game, whether it's still running, a draw, or if a player has won.
- **Board Display**: The board is displayed in a clean and structured way to show the current state after each move.
- **Input Validation**: Checks if a player is trying to place their mark in an empty position.

#### How the Game Works:
1. The board is displayed with numbered positions (1 to 9), where players can choose where to place their mark.
2. The game alternates turns between **Player 1 (X)** and **Player 2 (O)**.
3. After each move, the game checks if any player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
4. The winner (or draw) is displayed at the end of the game.

#### Instructions to Play:
- Run the game in your terminal or Python IDE.
- Player 1 will use 'X' and Player 2 will use 'O'.
- Enter a number between 1 and 9 to mark your position on the board.
- The game ends when one player wins or when the board is full (draw).

#### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: This project is implemented using Python and uses basic functionalities such as loops, conditionals, and functions to build the game logic.
